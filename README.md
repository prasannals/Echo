# Echo
Graph feature extractor and audio generator.

Echo extracts features from a graph and creates an audio representing the graph.(What does this mean in plain terms? If the graph is a facebook network, this gives your profile a unique sound based on the features of your network. The sound of your network if you may.) The features extracted are Clustering Coefficient, Jaccard Similarity and Degree Centrality. It also creates a visualization of the graph using JUNG library.
